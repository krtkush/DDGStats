# DDG Stats

DDG Stats is a Firefox web extension that adds a Google bang button right next to the Duckduckgo search bar. It also enables the user to view their DDG vs Google bang search stats.

With the stats feature you can now be sure you're statistically correct about your DDG usage in your next DDG vs Google argument on Hacker News or Reddit!

## Permissions, Data collection and Privacy

DDG Stats asks for following permissions - 

1. Storage: To store your DDG search and Google bang (!g) search count.
2. webNavigation: To identify your search type and then update the count.

DDG Stats stores all the data on your device only and does not transmit it to any remote computer/ server.
